# Depression detection
The first model is depression detection using text data, which is of utmost importance given the rising incidence of depression and other mental health disorders. By analyzing text data, our model can identify patterns and indicators of depression, enabling early intervention and appropriate resources.

Our model development process includes several key steps:

- [Data collection](https://github.com/Ziadashraf301/Mental-exploring/blob/main/Depression%20detection/Data%20collection%20and%20preprocessing.ipynb)
- [Data preprocessing](https://github.com/Ziadashraf301/Mental-exploring/blob/main/Depression%20detection/data_collection_and_preprocessing.py)
