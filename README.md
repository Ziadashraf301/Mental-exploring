# Mental-exploring
## Introduction
This repo contains my graduation project on mental health. Using Python, we explored mental health issues through data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and machine learning techniques. The project includes Jupyter notebooks, data pipeline files, and visualizations.

## Goal
The Mentality Exploring project is dedicated to promoting mental health awareness and providing individuals with a safe and accessible platform to explore their emotions and mental well-being. Our primary objective is to break down the barriers to mental health care by creating a non-judgmental space where people can learn about their sentiments, mental disorders, and emotions without fear of stigmatization. As the need for mental health resources continues to increase, we are honored to be a part of a project that empowers individuals to take control of their mental well-being and prioritize their mental health.

Our team has developed three machine learning and deep learning models to tackle various challenges in the field of mental health and emotional analysis.

- The first model focuses on depression detection using text data, which is of utmost importance given the rising incidence of depression and other mental health disorders. By analyzing text data, our model can identify patterns and indicators of depression, enabling early intervention and appropriate resources.

- The second model is designed for sentiment analysis, which helps understand people's emotions and attitudes towards specific topics or products. In fields such as marketing and customer service, sentiment analysis plays a crucial role in improving customer experiences and informing business decisions.

- Finally, our third model focuses on emotion detection using images, which is a fascinating area of research. This model has numerous applications, including detecting and preventing cyberbullying, improving mental health care and support, and helping individuals better understand and manage their emotions.
